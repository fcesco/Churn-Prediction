Accomplish a churn prediction and use the information to target push notification or reward to churning users might improve user retention. Moreover, understanding which features are the most important for users will focus the app improvements.

### <a name="data"></a> Data
Data is stored in a postgres database and in csv files. In the database there are 2 tables, one includes user and the other streams information. The analytics team of Streamago provided me also csv files. One csv file for each day called stream impression which include actions of users while watching a video. In the end, they provided me also a directed graph stored in a csv file with the information of the Streamago's social network.
